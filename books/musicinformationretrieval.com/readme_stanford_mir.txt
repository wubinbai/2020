musicinformationretrieval.com

stanford-mir is now musicinformationretrieval.com.

This repository contains instructional Jupyter notebooks related to music information retrieval (MIR). Inside these notebooks are Python code snippets that illustrate basic MIR systems.

The simplest way to use this repository is to (1) browse a read-only version of this repo at musicinformationretrieval.com, and (2) follow along using a blank Jupyter notebook of your own.
Installation

    Download and install Anaconda for Python 3.x.

    Install librosa and ffmpeg:

    conda install -c conda-forge librosa ffmpeg

    To upgrade:

    conda upgrade -c conda-forge librosa ffmpeg

[2018 June 24] These notebooks reflect the following package versions:

    ipython 6.2.1
    joblib 0.11
    jupyter 1.0.0
    librosa 0.6.1
    matplotlib 2.2.0
    numpy 1.14.2
    pandas 0.22.0
    scikit-learn 0.19.1
    scipy 1.0.0

Usage

    Start the Jupyter notebook server on your local machine. For Mac users, at the Terminal:

    your-local-machine:~$ jupyter notebook

    For Windows users, open the application "Jupyter Notebook". Alternatively for Windows: open the application "Anaconda Prompt" and type in jupyter notebook.

    Jupyter should automatically open a new window in your web browser that resembles a directory tree.

    To open a new notebook, in the new window of your web browser, click on New near the top right to open a new notebook.
        To rename the notebook, click on "Untitled" in the top left, and choose a different name.
        Inside a cell, run 1+2. Press <Shift-Enter> on a cell to run that cell. Hopefully you get the output 3.
        Inside a cell, run import scipy, sklearn, pandas, librosa. Press <Shift-Enter> to run the cell. If that runs without error, congratulations, you have the necessary libraries installed properly.
        Try executing the content from https://musicinformationretrieval.com inside this blank notebook.

    To close the Jupyter notebook,
        Save the notebook. (Either use keyboard shortcut s, or "File | Save" in the top menu.)
        Close the browser window.
        If you opened the notebook from a prompt/shell as indicated in Step 1 above, from that shell, press <Ctrl-C> twice to return to the prompt.

Congratulations, you are now running a Jupyter notebook, and you can get started with the notebooks in this repository.

After installing, if something doesnâ€™t work, try closing the terminal or restarting the OS. Sometimes that can reset the necessary configurations.
Troubleshooting

Issue #729: import librosa causes TypeError: expected string or buffer

    Workaround: downgrade joblib to v0.11:

    pip install joblib==0.11
