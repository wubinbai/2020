# 
# Thank you for all the competitors, kaggle teams, and the host of this competition!  
# We enjoyed a lot during the competition and learned many things.  
# 
# None of us had experience with audio data, and we also didn't get used to use Nerual Networks.  
# We especially want to thank [@daisukelab](https://www.kaggle.com/daisukelab) for his clear instruction with great kernels and datasets, [@mhiro2](https://www.kaggle.com/mhiro2) for sharing excellent training framework, and [@sailorwei](https://www.kaggle.com/sailorwei) for showing his Inception v3 model in his public kernel. We were helped a lot with public kernels below shared by them.

# https://www.kaggle.com/mhiro2/simple-2d-cnn-classifier-with-pytorch  
# https://www.kaggle.com/sailorwei/fat2019-2d-cnn-with-mixup-lb-0-673
# 
# We've created a kernel to explain team [kaggler-ja] Shirogane's solution.
# 
# In short, our solution is 3 models ensemble, one is **Custom CNN** and the other two are **Inception v3** models.  
# We used **Log-Melspectrogram** features made with the manner introduced by @daisukelab in his great dataset.
# 
# https://www.kaggle.com/daisukelab/fat2019_prep_mels1  
# 
# We used noisy data for **warm-up**, just like pre-training the model, and curated data for **fine-tuning** the model, which was trained in earlier stage with noisy data.
# 
# **All the works for this competition were done with kaggle kernels**, and we'd like to thank a lot to kaggle for giving us great opportunities and computing resources.

# ## Data Augmentation

# We created augmented training dataset with [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/).  
# Sox is an open-source synthesis tool, which is easy to use from command line interface, and is installed to Kaggle kernel by default.
# 
# We can use sox like this.

# ### pitch shift

# This augmentation changes the pitch of the sound.  
# We applied both pitch-up and pitch-down.  
# The degree of pitch shift was fixed to 500 cent.

# ## Crop Policy

# ### Uniform Crop

# We use random crop, because we use fixed image size(128 * 128). Random crop got a little better cv than the first 2 seconds cropped. At first, it wa cropped uniformly as mhiro's kernel.

# ### Strength Adaptive Crop

# Many sound crip has important information at the first few seconds. Some sample has it in the middle of crip. However, due to the nature of recording, it is rare to have important information at th end of sounds. The score drops about 0.03~0.04 when learning only the last few seconds.
# 
# Then, We introduce Strength Adaptive Crop. We tried to crop the place where the total of db is high preferentially.
# 
# This method is very effective because most samples contain important information in places where the sound is loud.
# 
# CV 0.01 up
# LB 0.004~0.005 up

# ### Custom CNN

# At first, we worked a lot on our custom CNN model. We started from improving [CVSSP Baseline](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging-2019/discussion/89382#latest-534349).   
# We changed kernel size, number of Convolution Blocks, **Pooling policy**, and the **structure of the fully connected layer**. We also added **spatial and channel attention**.  
# The original CVSSP Baseline model structure is below.

# The difference from the original model is...
# 
# #### kernel size
# 
# We don't know why, but the size (2, 2) was the best.
# 
# #### The nuber of convolution blocks
# 
# We used 5 blocks to get 512 channels feature map. This is because we designed our model considering the meaning of each blocks (,although we're not sure whether it is working as we imaged originally).  
# We found [@omalleyt](https://www.kaggle.com/omalleyt)'s 2nd place solution for Tensorflow Speech Recognition Competition very helpful.  
# https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/forums/t/47715/2nd-place-solution?forumMessageId=270205#post270205
# 
# The *design philosophy* behind the placement of convolution blocks are as follows.
# 
#   - First Convolution Block: channel 1 -> 32, no pooling.  
#     We put this block to collect primitive patterns of the log-melspectrogram.
#   - Second Convolution Block: channel 32 -> 64, (4, 1) pooling.  
#     Clearly, **spectrogram has different axis, and we need to treat them separately**. We took careful **not to aggregate the feature map along to the time axis and to the frequency axis simultaneously**. In this block, we'll get the primitive patterns connected to the patterns nearby in the time axis.
#   - Third Convolution Block: channel 64 -> 128, (1, 3) pooling.  
#     In this block, we'll get the primitive pattens connected in the frequency axis.
#   - Fourth Convolution Block: channel 128 -> 256, (4, 1) pooling.  
#     This block allows patterns to move in the time axis.
#   - Fifth Convolution Block: channel 256 -> 512, (1, 3) pooling.  
#     As explained in this [blog post](https://t.co/IgUKfFOYaa), moving the pattern in the frequency can be problematic. But that isn't the case when the degree of the translation is not so big. This block allows patterns to move in the frequency axis a little.
#     
# #### Cutting output feature map to arbitrary size
# 
# We found that the position in the feature map is important when treating spectrogram.  
# The same pattern at the bottom of the image and at the top of the image are totally different. We should not allow patterns translate along the frequency axis. That is a little bit different from treating natural images.
# 
# To treat the position in the feature map, we used **[spatial pyramid pooling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.4729.pdf)** to catch the local features.  
# With this trick, CV lwlrap score improved **0.015 - 0.03**.

# ### Inception v3
# 
# We used two Inception v3 models. One is all the same as the original Inception v3 architecture, so we simply used the one in `torchvision.models` package. The other one was 1ch version of the original Inception v3, so we just simply altered the first layer.  
# The score of the 1ch version was not as stable as 3ch version, but we found that model a little bit different from the original one.  

# ## Augmentation in Batch

# ### Pretrain with Noisy Data

# We used noisy data to 'pre-train' our model.  
# We had two policy to train and validate with noisy data.  
# You can see how we did this in [this kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/hidehisaarai1213/convnet-noisy-all-pitch-pretraining).
# 
# 1. Train with all the noisy data, validate with curated data.
# 2. Split noisy data with `train_test_split`. Both train and validate are done with only noisy data.
# 
# We tried both policy, and found it surprising that policy 2 was slightly better than policy 1. We believe it was just a seed magic, but the model trained with policy12 were at least as better as the model trained with policy1.  
# 
# We used [@mhiro2's way](https://www.kaggle.com/mhiro2/simple-2d-cnn-classifier-with-pytorch) to train, which means 
# 
# - change learning rate with CosineAnnealingLR cyclickally in the range between 1e-3 and 1e-5. The cycle was 10 epochs.
# - use Adam optimizer.
# - optimize BCEWithLogitLoss
# 
# We also used augmented data in this stage.  
# We created a `pitch` augmented dataset from train_noisy dataset and used it only for training.  
# We only used train_noisy dataset for validation.
# 
# In the pre-training of Inception models, we applied RandomResizedCrop to the data, and it required us to train longer, so we introduced stage 2 pre-training.  
# In the stage2 pre-training, we didn't changed any settings except for the initial weight of the network.
# 
# With pre-training, local lwlrap jumped from **0.83 to 0.88** with Custom CNN, and **0.86 to 0.87** with Inception v3.  
# Unfortunately, we don't know how much the LB lwlrap score improved with Custom CNN, but the LB lwlrap score of Inception v3 improved **0.01** with this trick.

# ### Training with Curated Data

# We used curated data to 'finetune' the models, which were 'pre-trained' with noisy data.  
# We used augmented dataset with original train_curated dataset, which made the whole training dataset 8 times larger than the original one.  
# 
# We used normal `KFold` to get cross validation, and split the dataset into 5 subsets.  
# Since the size of each augmented dataset is all the same as the original one, which means 4970, and the order of them are all the same, it was easy to avoid data leak.  
# We simply used the same indices for splitting original dataset and augmented datasets.  
# One thing to note is that we didn't used augmented dataset for validation. The reason is simple, the size was to large.
# 
# [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/hidehisaarai1213/freesound-dameoshi-aug-fold5)'s one of the kernel to conduct learning with curated data.

# ### TTA for Validation

# It is very effective to use tta because we use random crop. Especially, since we use random resized crop, tta is very important. When RandomResizedCrop is used, val score fluctuate,so if val tta is not used, an appropriate epoch can not be selected. So, we used tta for validation to ensure that validation can be properly evaluated.

# ## Ensemble

# We end up with simply blending the output with the same weight, which means `(CustomCNN + Inception v3 3ch + Inception v3 1ch) / 3` but we tried a lot to use many models with comparatively low scores around `0.700 - 0.710`.  
# Also we faced the problem of **Blend Many Models** vs **Increasing the number of TTA**.  
# 
# With careful experiment, we found that Inception model was comparatively unstable and requires comparatively large number of TTA, which was around 20 - 25 times.  
# Finaly, we decided to use 20 TTA for each model, and blend 5 fold * 3models = 15model with equally weighted manner.
