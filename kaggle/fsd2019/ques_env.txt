I have a very huge confusion about the environment, created by conda.

So here's the background, I have the 9th place code of the 2019 Freesound competition in Kaggle. It has the following environment as a requirement.txt file:


tensorflow_gpu==1.11.0
numpy==1.14.2
tqdm==4.22.0
librosa==0.6.3
scipy==1.0.0
iterative_stratification==0.1.6
Keras==2.1.5
pandas==0.24.2
scikit_learn==0.21.2


So I try to use conda to create a new environment using this command in ubuntu:

conda create --name TOP2 --file requirements.txt  

However, it says that some packages are not fuond in current channels.(Although some are found) So the installation seemed not working.



#### the error message anaconda shows is as the following:

wb@wb-HP-Elit(base) wb@wb-HP-EliteBook-8770w:/media/wb/111GB/TEMP_SPACE/freesound2019/2nd_code/code$ conda create --name TRASH --file requirements.txt

  - librosa==0.6.3
  - scikit_learn==0.21.2
  - tqdm==4.22.0
  - iterative_stratification==0.1.6

Current channels:

  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/linux-64
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/noarch
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/linux-64
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/noarch

To search for alternate channels that may provide the conda package you're
looking for, navigate to

    https://anaconda.org

and use the search bar at the top of the page.


#### The above shows the message conda showed


So I decompose the txt file into two txt files, one contains those packages that are found(namely, requirements_found.txt), the other one(namely, requirements_not_found.txt) containining packages that are not found. And use the conda create --name TOP2 --file requirements_found.txt command to create a new environment whose name is TOP2 and it was successful. I use "conda activate TOP2" to activate the environment, and then manually install the remaining packages that were not installed, using command such as:

conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn=0.21.2

Well, everything worked, except for tenworflow-gpu=1.11.0:

it says xxxxx Found conflicts! Then conda checks older versions of some related packages(maybe its dependencies) and says, for example,

Finding shortest conflict path for libcblas=3.8.0
then after waiting some (1-120, generally it's a very long process) minutes, it becomes 100%. Then it seems there are endless packages to check and modify, this may include something like libcblas=3.6.0? protobuf=3.4.0, xxxx=5.2.0 aaa=5.3.3, WHICH IS A NIGHTMARE. I waited for 6-10 hours, and it is still working on. After 10+ hours it finally  ends. But conda still prints something that are not working well. So I suspect that something went wrong. When I activate the environment and use tf.__version__ to check, WHAT IT RETURNS TO ME is 1.3.0, which is, I think a very old version of tf.

So, I ran 

conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow-gpu=1.11.0 again and wait for another 12+ hours. After I get up, it is still working on.....(it seemes never stops, but the process is going, as I can tell from the status bar)




SO THE QUESTION IS:


So, NOW is 2019 Jan, while the package environment is 2018 Aug., I am wondering what is the best way to recover this environment???????????
